# route_handler

A simple abstraction that provides a structured guideline for named route handling in Flutter.

It supports query parameters for url-like behaviors and, via the `routeExtra` property it is possible to provider more complex objects to the route.

## Usage

Just `extend` the `RouteHandler` class and implement its `getRoute` method.
